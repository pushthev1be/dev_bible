🎯 What It Does
---------------
Captures 5 types of project lessons in a simple JSONL file:

  1. PRINCIPLE  → Architectural truths
  2. PATTERN    → Reusable solutions
  3. MISTAKE    → Bugs you've fixed (your "scars")
  4. RUNBOOK    → Step-by-step guides
  5. DECISION   → Why you chose X over Y

🚀 Quick Start (30 seconds)
---------------------------
cd /path/to/your-project
cp -r /path/to/dev_bible ./
make -C dev_bible stats
make -C dev_bible add-lesson

🔍 Daily Use (2 commands)
-------------------------
# Before coding: search for lessons
grep '"relevant-tag"' dev_bible/bible.jsonl

# After coding: append what you learned  
echo '{"type":"MISTAKE",...}' >> dev_bible/bible.jsonl

✨ Key Features
---------------
  ✓ Append-only (never lose knowledge)
  ✓ Grep-friendly (instant search)
  ✓ Git-friendly (text files, good diffs)
  ✓ CI-ready (validator included)
  ✓ Zero dependencies (just bash, grep, make)
  ✓ Language agnostic (works for any project)
  ✓ Scales forever (JSONL handles millions of lines)

  ✓ CI/CD pipelines (validate on build)
  ✓ AI assistants (search before coding)
  ✓ Documentation (auto-generate from lessons)

📖 Philosophy
-------------
Every project accumulates knowledge through bugs fixed, patterns discovered,
and decisions made. The Bible captures that knowledge in a format that's:
  - Easy to write (one line = one lesson)
  - Easy to search (grep + tags)
  - Easy to maintain (append-only, never edit)
  - Easy to share (plain text, version controlled)

🎓 Learn More
-------------
Start here:         READ → README.md
Quick reference:    READ → CHEATSHEET.md
Real examples:      READ → EXAMPLE_SESSION.md
Installation help:  READ → INSTALL.md
Advanced usage:     READ → USAGE_GUIDE.md

💡 The Value Proposition
------------------------
Week 1:   Add 3-5 lessons (bugs you've already fixed)
Week 2:   Search before coding (find 1 relevant lesson)  
Week 4:   New dev onboards faster (reads your mistakes)
Month 3:  Bible has 50+ lessons (saves hours per sprint)
Year 1:   Bible has 200+ lessons (irreplaceable asset)

The Bible compounds. Every lesson written saves time forever.

🌟 Success Pattern
------------------
1. Install in your project (5 minutes)
2. Add one lesson today (2 minutes)
3. Search before every feature (30 seconds)
4. Append after every fix (1 minute)
5. Review monthly (5 minutes)

By month 2, you'll wonder how you lived without it.

📝 License & Customization
--------------------------
This is a template/tool, not a library. Customize freely:
  - Change file locations
  - Modify lesson types
  - Add custom fields
  - Extend the Makefile
  - Adapt to your workflow

No attribution needed. Make it yours.

🚨 Important Rules
------------------
1. Append only (never edit old lessons, add v2 instead)
2. One idea per line (keep lessons atomic)
3. Tag everything (makes grep work)
4. Validate before commit (catch errors early)
5. Search before coding (use your knowledge)

🎉 Ready to Go!
---------------
You have everything you need. Copy the folder into your project
and add your first lesson today.
